This is a small program that demonstrates basic communication using UDP sockets with Selective Repeat Protocol

PORT NUMBER is fixed in port.h

TO RUN:
    //client
    ./udp-send <file-path> <file-name> <server-IP>

    //server
    ./udp-recv <file-path>

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:

    During the coding process, I have consulted at https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/417/notes/sockets/files/demo-udp-04.zip for help with setting up UDP sockets.
